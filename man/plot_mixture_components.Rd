\title{Wrapper function for \code{\link{plot.Mclust}}}
\usage{
plot_mixture_components(
  x,
  what = "uncertainty",
  iteration = NULL,
  datapoints = "proposed",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The output from the function \code{\link{amis}}.}

\item{what}{A string specifying the type of plot requested:
\describe{
\item{\code{"uncertainty"}}{A plot of classification uncertainty (default)}
\item{\code{"density"}}{A plot of estimated density}
\item{\code{"BIC"}}{A plot showing BIC values used to choose the number of components}
}}

\item{iteration}{Integer indicating which iteration the plot should be about.
If NULL (default), the plot will be for the final iteration.
See more details in \code{\link{plot.Mclust}}.}

\item{datapoints}{A string specifying what the datapoints should represent in the
plot of classification uncertainty:
\describe{
\item{\code{"proposed"}}{datapoints will represent the samples simulated from the mixture.
The colours indicate which mixture components the samples were simulated from.}
\item{\code{"fitted"}}{datapoints will show the samples that the mixture model was fitted to,
i.e. weighted samples from the previous iteration.
The colour of a datapoint indicates the most likely mixture component the sample belongs to, and
the point size represents the probability that the sample belongs to that component.}
}}

\item{...}{Other arguments to match the \code{plot.Mclust} function}

\value{
A plot for model-based clustering results.
