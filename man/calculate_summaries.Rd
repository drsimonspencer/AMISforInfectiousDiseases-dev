\title{Calculate summaries of weighted statistics}
\usage{
calculate_summaries(
  x,
  what = "prev",
  time = 1,
  locations = NULL,
  alpha = 0.05,
  exceedance_prob_threshold = 0.35
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The output from the function \code{\link{amis}}.}

\item{what}{What statistic should be calculated the summaries from.
It must be either 'prev' or the name of one of the model parameters. Default to 'prev'.}

\item{time}{Time point. Only used if 'what' is set to 'prev'.}

\item{locations}{Integer vector or location names identifying locations where
summaries should be calculated for. If not specified, summary statistics of
all locations will be provided.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric value between 0 and 1. Calculations are for the (alpha/2, 1-alpha/2)\% quantiles.}

\item{exceedance_prob_threshold}{Numeric value. Default to 0.35, i.e. the
probability that the statistic of interest (e.g. prevalence) is higher than 0.35.}
}
\value{
A list with mean, median, and quantiles of the weighted distribution
}
